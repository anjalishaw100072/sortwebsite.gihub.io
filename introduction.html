    Sorting refers to arranging data in a particular format. Sorting algorithm specifies the way to arrange data in a particular order. Most common orders are in numerical or lexicographical order.
        <br>
        The importance of sorting lies in the fact that data searching can be optimized to a very high level, if data is stored in a sorted manner. Sorting is also used to represent data in more readable formats. Following are some of the examples of sorting in real-life scenarios −
        <br>
        <br>
<b>Telephone Directory</b> − The telephone directory stores the telephone numbers of people sorted by their names, so that the names can be searched easily.
<br>
<br>
<b>Dictionary </b>− The dictionary stores words in an alphabetical order so that searching of any word becomes easy.

        <b> Adaptive Sorting Algorithm</b>
        <br>
        A sorting algorithm is said to be adaptive, if it takes advantage of already 'sorted' elements in the list that is to be sorted. That is, while sorting if the source list has some element already sorted, adaptive algorithms will take this into account and will try not to re-order them.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>  Non - Adaptive Sorting Algorithm</b>
        <br>
        A non-adaptive algorithm is one which does not take into account the elements which are already sorted. They try to force every single element to be re-ordered to confirm their sortedness.
