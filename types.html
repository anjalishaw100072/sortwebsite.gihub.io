        In data processing, there are various sorting methods and techniques that are not only used for sorting algorithms but are also used for analyzing the performance of other algorithms. In this post, you will find a brief description of the different types of sorting algorithms.

    <b>In-Place Sorting</b>
    <br>
    Sorting algorithms may require some extra space for comparison and temporary storage of few data elements. These algorithms do not require any extra space and sorting is said to happen in-place, or for example, within the array itself. This is called in-place sorting. Bubble sort is an example of in-place sorting.
    <br><br>
    <b>Not-In-Place Sorting</b>
    <br>
    In some sorting algorithms, the program requires space which is more than or equal to the elements being sorted. Sorting which uses equal or more space is called not-in-place sorting. Merge-sort is an example of not-in-place sorting.

    <b>Stable Sorting</b>
    <br>
    If a sorting algorithm, after sorting the contents, does not change the sequence of similar content in which they appear, it is called stable sorting.

    <b>Unstable Sorting</b>
    <br>
    If a sorting algorithm, after sorting the contents, changes the sequence of similar content in which they appear, it is called unstable sorting.
